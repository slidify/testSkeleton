### About Skeleton

Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17in laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in action.

### Three Core Principles

Skeleton is built on three core principles:

- __A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile__: Elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile.
- __Fast to Start__: It's a tool for rapid development with best practices
- __Style Agnostic__: It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.
